# 🧑‍🎓 **About Me**

I’m **Daksh Saxena**, a first-year **B.Tech AIML student at KIET**.
I enjoy understanding how things work under the hood — whether it's programming, math, or basic AI concepts.

As of now, I'm exploring:

* C & Python
* AI & ML Basics
* Data Structures
* Web Development

My goal is to build a **strong foundation** and become a developer who understands concepts deeply — not superficially.
